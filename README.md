# Side-by-side comparison of Svelte and React

This repository contains two identical applications, one using Svelte, and the other using React. These applications were made to identify the differences between coding in Svelte and coding in React.


To run the [Svelte App](sbs-svelte/), navigate to the above location in terminal, and execute:
```
npm run dev
```
Then navigate to localhost:5173 in your web browser of choice.


To run the [React App](sbs-react/), navigate to the above location in terminal, and execute:
```
npm start
```
This should automatically launch your default browser and navigate to localhost:5000
